# MAD Plugin - Shiny Watcher

Get support on this [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cMZs5tk)

Shiny watcher plugin is not a standalone feature and is not something to put in your phone. It is a feature from a very complex system that you have to understand. If you don't understand the Wiki and how to make your own map, you don't have any way to use it yourself.

Shiny Watcher checks your DB for active Shinies and then sends a notification to Discord if it finds any. It allows you to filter out Pokemon and Workers as well as connect a Login E-Mail to every worker.

Notifications are in the format: `Pokemon-name IV% Level# CP# Gender:symbol; Despawns: Time (time left); Worker name (account/email or PTC)`. On Android devices, the coordinates are embeded so you can copy them by long-pressing (for ~2 seconds). Fast and easy. There's also an option to optimize what is displayed for iOS.

- a deparate <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications/">Discord Bot</a> is required to use CatchHelper
- `game_stats_raw` must be enabled within your MAD config
- Pingusermapping and CatchHelper are optional
- Credits to [CCEV](https://github.com/ccev/shinywatcher) who created the original version of shinywatcher
- Special Credits to <a href="https://github.com/crhbetz">crhbetz</a> who made CatchHelper run in the plugin system
- and ghosttaker as I forked this from him and made some changes in this 

## Getting Started

- Fill out plugin.ini (it's explained below what to fill in)
- restart MAD to activate the plugin configuration

## What to fill in
### Config
copy plugin.ini.example to plugin.ini and adjust it with your data
- `ONLY_SHOW_WORKERS` Leave blank if you want notifications from all workers. If you only want them from certain Accounts, follow the format in the example
- `EXCLUDE_MONS` Filter out Mons you already have enough Shinies of. Follow the example format!
- `OS` Set your notifications to `android` or `ios` mode. On Android, messages have an embed contaning the coords. For iOS an extra message containing coords will be sent

### Pingusermapping
Ping one or more users in Discord when the mapped Scanner encounters a shiny. To get your User ID or anyone else’s User ID right click on their name and click “Copy ID” Alternative type there name as a mention and place a backslash \ in front of the mention.
